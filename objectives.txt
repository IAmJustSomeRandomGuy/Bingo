bingo size is recommended 4 or 5
box size is recommended 5 or 6
bingo_size = 5
box_size = 6
keep_json_file_checked = False

for every catagorie there should be ...objectives: <- like this
and then objectives bellow

I recommend putting easier -> harder catagories so some text makes sence
(when you don't have enough objectives it moves to a harder catagorie and once it reaches the hardest catagorie it goes to easier catagories)
(medium -> hard -> very hard -> easy -> very easy)

you can only create/import bingo.json files when you have bingo size 5

if you have a bingo.json file (with correct formating) then you can import it directly (you don't even need the same code/objectives.txt)
