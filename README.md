# Bingo

I used **PySimpleGUI** for this project

I made this originaly for the game west of loathing but then made it usable for whatever (so just ignore the quests in *objectives.txt*)

you use it by changing the *objectives.txt*

to have the same quests as your friend you have to have the **exact same** *objectives.txt* and then send the generated code

you can generate a JSON file for https://www.bingosync.com/

you can also load from a JSON file

(the compiled.zip contains the exe and all the files)
